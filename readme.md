# pipe_exec

Execute ELF binaries from pipes & and terminals. This makes it possible to
execute binaries that are not stored in a file system or for
which the execute permission is not set and to run binaries
directly from stdin; e.g. when piping gcc output or when
downloading them via SSH.

It works by allocating an in-memory file via the
memfd_create(2) syscall, copying all data from the
executable there and finally executing it using the
fexecve(3) syscall.

pipe_exec will first try to execute the file in place; e.g.
`pexec </bin/ls` would not load ls into memory first.


## Usage

```sh
$ cat `which date` | pexec -u
Sun Jul  3 21:09:36 UTC 2016
```

## Installation

Install the required packages:

- build-essential

And then compile the code:

```sh
make
```

To install copy the binaries to /usr/local/bin or execute this command
which will perform the copy for you.

```sh
sudo make install
```

You can supply `$PREFIX` to use a different installation directory; the
default prefix is `/usr/local.`
